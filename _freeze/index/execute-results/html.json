But as\nENSO is a phenomenon of both the atmosphere and the ocean, there're a\nfew ways to measure it. We're going to compare those to see if it makes\na lot of difference to our classifications.\n\nOn the ocean side, the NINO34 index---also called the Oceanic Nino Index\n(ONI)---defines sea surface temperatures in the mid-eastern Pacific. An\nanomaly in that area from the long term average of at least +0.5°C\ndefines an El Niño, while lower than -0.5°C defines a La Niña.\n\nOn the atmospheric side, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) compares\nthe air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin. An SOI below -8\nfor an extended period defines an El Niño; an SOI above +8 defines a La\nNiña.\n\nONI is NOAA's primary index for El Ni˜no measurement, but the Australian\nBureau of Meteorology typically looks at both (as well as dynamical\nfactors and seasonal forecast models) to make the call.\n\nLet's load data in for both and compare. Nino3.4 comes from the [NASA\nPhysical Sciences\nLaboratory](https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Nino34/):\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: 17 parsing failures.\nrow  col               expected    actual                                                             file\n155 year no trailing characters -99.99    '/workspaces/report-elnino/data/nasa-nino34-anomaly-monthly.txt'\n155 NA   13 columns             1 columns '/workspaces/report-elnino/data/nasa-nino34-anomaly-monthly.txt'\n156 year no trailing characters NINA34    '/workspaces/report-elnino/data/nasa-nino34-anomaly-monthly.txt'\n156 NA   13 columns             1 columns '/workspaces/report-elnino/data/nasa-nino34-anomaly-monthly.txt'\n157 year no trailing characters 5N-5S     '/workspaces/report-elnino/data/nasa-nino34-anomaly-monthly.txt'\n... .... ...................... ......... ................................................................\nSee problems(...) for more details.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAnd here's SOI over June-Sep each year:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 1769 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): year_month, soi\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nNow we can join and compare the two:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nWhen we demand that both indicators agree on a phase, we get a subset of\nthe years manually indicated as an El Niño or La Niña by the Bureau of\nMeteorology.
